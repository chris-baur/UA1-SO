Thursday February 1st Meeting (1PM-3PM)

Purpose: Finalize the 1st Sprint tasks

IMPORTANT:
  - Need to organize the files/project (Which was done by EL Derbi i think - very beautiful website ! Great work)
  - The way we are using git is not correct (in my opinion)
  	- Clone or Download -> Open in Desktop
  	- Open with Sublime Text for example
  	- Commit (write a summary+comment before)
  	- Push (or Pull if someone has pushed before your changes)
PROJECT:
  - Make the login/sign up working

  Done!
