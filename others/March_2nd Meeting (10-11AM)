March 2nd Meeting (10-11AM)

Purpose: MEET THE REQUIREMENTS OF SPRINT 3 AT LEAST !!!
	- Breakdown of sprint 3 and sprint 4 tasks
	- Create tasks in the issues tab in Git (https://github.com/chris-baur/UA1-SO/issues)
	- Assign points, deadlines to tasks
	- Create a burndown chart: Efforts in points depending on time (from sprint 1 to final sprint)
	- Create a testing/validation process to do each time a commit is pushed. The commiter will have to comment that he has done the testing

NOTE: We dont have much time to lose now. Everyone needs to participate. If you're not ready to go through all the coding and implement new features... do something else like assigning points/creating issues or a testing validation process... FIND A WAY TO PARTICIPATE !! (Documentation, burndown chart, ...) If you go through course material you'll find more non-coding tasks.

NOTE2: The purpose of this project is not to see coding skills.. its about the process in which we are all working together on the same project. For us to get full grade (which is what we want I assume..) we need everyone to put his 100%.
