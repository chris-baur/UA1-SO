Questions to ask:

Are there any restrictions to the programming language that we can use?
Is there something specific that we should accomplish for each sprint or do we ourselves have to set the goals of each sprint ourselves.
Should the log in information for a user have to include any personal details such as date of birth or e-mail, etc.
